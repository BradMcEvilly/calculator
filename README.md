# Calculator

Calculator created using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with the below constraints

## Functional Specs

* The calculator should be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide
* The input element should reflect user interaction with the buttons – **_NOTE: It is not meant to be a true input field_**
* When the user hits the "=" button or enter button, the result will appear in the result block
* The calculator should respect order of operations: _multiply_ and _divide_ are calculated before _plus_ and _minus_
* __Clear__ will clear the most recent entry
* The user can chain operations via multiple operations within the component
